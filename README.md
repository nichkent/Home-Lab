# Home-Lab Traffic Simulation: Attack and IDS

Created a home lab with a NAT Network setup. This NAT network is meant to simulate an end user connecting to a server with another user attempting to intercept packet transmission between the two devices. The lab consists of three Virtual Machines run through Oracle's VirtualBox. Two of the VM's are loaded with an up to date Window's 11 version in order to simulate the most likely situation of two devices connecting in the real world. These two VM's (Zues and Hermes) are meant to simulate the end user (Hermes) and the server (Zues) they are attempting to communicate with. The third VM (Hera) is loaded with an up to date version of kali linux. Kali linux is a open source distribution of Linux that is preloaded with many tools that help with packet capture such as Wireshark. Additionally, Scapy was downloaded on this VM in order to write programs to intercept these packets from python alone.
